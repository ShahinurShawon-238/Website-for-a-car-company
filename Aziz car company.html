             The preservation and restoration of automobiles is the mechanical or cosmetic repair of cars. For example, the guidelines of the Antique Automobile Club of America are to evaluate an antique vehicle, which has been restored to the same state as the dealer could have prepared the vehicle for delivery to the customer. Restoration means removing, replacing, or repairing the parts of a vehicle, while preservation means keeping the original components. Though automotive restoration is commonly defined as the reconditioning of a vehicle from an original condition in an effort to return it to like-new or better condition, There are many styles of which a vehicle can be restored, any of which can be performed at the discretion, desire, or taste of a vehicle owner or restorer.

        <p class="project_def2">Introduced in 1967, the Pontiac Firebird took styling cues from both the Pontiac GTO and Chevy Camaro. While the first generation of this car is great, it’s the beginning of the second generation (which ran through 1981) that we’re most interested in. There’s something special about the styling of the ’70-’73 Trans Ams that really gets those classic muscle juices flowing. As a GM vehicle, you can bet that many parts are shared between vehicles from this era, which means that finding parts shouldn’t be terribly difficult. This may come in handy with a 1972 model, which produced only half of the average number of examples due to a worker strike.</p>

       <h1>12 Ways to Ruin a Restoration -- And How to Avoid Them</h1>
       <p>Posted Jul28,2018</p>
       <p>Time is money. Nothing could be truer when it comes to restoring a muscle car, because whether it is plowing forward with a structurally shaky rust bucket or nailing the elemental attention to detail, most of a project’s success or failure can be traced to the clock.It doesn’t matter whether you’re tackling a first-time resto yourself or entrusting your car to seasoned professionals. The issues and details that sink a restoration are often due to lousy time management, which can prolong the project to balloon the cost or trigger cost-cutting moves that are ultimately revealed in a poor-quality final product.

       <p>You find a good car, you cannot sit,” Matt Barczak says. Just 35 years old, Matt feels he was born 30 years too late. “I love, professionally restore, and collect muscle cars. I work with Frank Arone, owner of Arone Restorations in Homer City, Pennsylvania.” Matt was driving to Pittsburgh with his father and Frank to look at a 7,000-mile, original paint, 1969 Hemi Road Runner, an old race car with no motor or transmission.
