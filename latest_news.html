       <h1>NHRA Museum to fete hot rod artist Robert Williams</h1>
       <p>Posted Jul25,2018</p>
       <p>Ahead of a retrospective show in 2015, Robert Williams told the Los Angeles Times that he’s no fan of “lowbrow” or the stuffier “pop surrealism” terms that have often described his work. Instead, he said, he prefers “feral art” because the art has “had to raise itself out in the wilderness.” Which is not to say that his art hasn’t more recently found its way out of the wilderness, a journey punctuated by the NHRA Motorsports Museum’s upcoming event celebrating the hot-rod artist.</p>

        <h1>NASCAR Hall of Fame probes stock car history with new exhibits</h1>
        <p>Posted Jun25,2018</p>
        <p>By no means did stock car racing start with NASCAR. Rather, a patchwork of stock car racing organizations blanketed the country before and immediately after World War II, and hardly any of them agreed on rules, race structure, or driver eligibility. Promoter Bill France aimed to rectify that situation, and his efforts – along with those of many others – forms the basis of the NASCAR Hall of Fame’s upcoming exhibit, “1948: Proving Grounds.”</p>

       <p>AORDINARY CAR BUYERS SEEM CONTENT TO KEEP DOING WHAT THEY'VE ALWAYS DONE -- DRIVE THEMSELVES.Detroit has hosted one of the world’s most important auto shows for the past three decades. For a week each January, the city’s cavernous Cobo Center turns into a lavish celebration of automotive performance and design.

        <h1>1972 Chevrolet Nova Build</h1>
        <p>Posted Jan25,2018</p>
        <p>The RKM Performance Center completes a wide variety of projects. Sometimes we build one-of-a-kind, ground-up pro-tourers. Sometimes we build an engine. Sometimes we spray a little paint. And sometimes, as in the case of this 1972 Chevrolet Nova, we only build half the car. Generally, projects like back-halfing are brought to us by enthusiasts who are pretty good with a wrench, but simply don’t have the skill or will to tackle major fabrication. That’s exactly what happened with this cool Chevy. Restored by a father and son team, the car had been worked into a solid driver that could be enjoyed on the street or at the eighth.
