        <p class="project_def">Introduced in 1967, the Pontiac Firebird took styling cues from both the Pontiac GTO and Chevy Camaro. While the first generation of this car is great, it’s the beginning of the second generation (which ran through 1981) that we’re most interested in. There’s something special about the styling of the ’70-’73 Trans Ams that really gets those classic muscle juices flowing. As a GM vehicle, you can bet that many parts are shared between vehicles from this era, which means that finding parts shouldn’t be terribly difficult. This may come in handy with a 1972 model, which produced only half of the average number of examples due to a worker strike.</p>
